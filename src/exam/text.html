Task: Poker Tournament Simulation
A poker tournament is simulated in the program Tournamentsimulator, java. Some players participate in the tournament, during which they can win or lose money. The code consists of four classes: TournamentSimulator, here is the main() method, Player, which represents a player, Tournament which represents the tournament, and Evaluator which evaluates the results of the players in the competition.
The basic structure of the code should not be changed, but it can be supplemented with helper methods and variables.

1 Task (30 points)
• TournamentSimulator:
• Call the setup( method in main().
• Launch the waitForTournament) and the start) methods on a new thread respectively.
• Using the TOURNAMENT_DURATION_MSEC the program should wait as much time until the tournament is over.
• When the tournament is over the simulation should stop at most after EVALUATION_DURATION_MSEC time.
• Player:
• Implement the waitForTournament) method: a player should until the tournament starts and then calls the participateln Tournament) method.
• Implement the participateln Tournament() method: a player should wait until the tournament is over.
• Tournament:
• Create a data structure to store the participating Players.
• Implement the start() method; first wait for startTime time then notify the participants the tournament has started. Next, we
call Player's addParticipationCost) method with the amount of the tournament entry fee. Then wait duration much time and then notify the participating players the tournament is over.
• Implement the addPlayer) method; The Player that was passed as a parameter to this method should be added to the data structure storing players.

2 Task (10 points)
• TournamentSimulator:
• After waiting for TOURNAMENT_DURATION_MSEC, notify the players that the tournament is over.
• Player:
• At the end of the participateln Tournament() method, call the evaluate() method.
• Call the tryEvaluatePlayer() method on a single instance of the Evaluator class. If the call fails (returns false), then wait WAIT_TIME_MSEC and try again. If the evaluation was successful, exit the method.
3 Task (10 points)

All that remains is the evaluation of the tournament, which is the responsibility of the Evaluator class.
• Create a data structure for the player register with LIMIT capacity.
• Let's create a logical variable for the state of the evaluator. This variable tracks when the Evaluator is ready to evaluate a next player.
• Implement the startEvaluation) method:
• The variable you just created should initially indicate that the evaluator is ready to evaluate players.
• Wait WAIT_TIME_MSEC.
• Write to the standard output that LIMIT number of players are to be evaluated.
• Set the value of the logical variable to false.
• Wait for EVALUATION_PREPARATION_TIME_MSEC.
• If there is no player to be evaluated, exit the loop.
• If there is, generate a random integer in the interval [-10, 10).
• If the result is zero, add one.
• From the players waiting for evaluation, let's take the first one out of the data structure.
• If the randomly generated number is positive, then write to the standard output that the player's prize is the product of the participation fee multiplied by the randomly generated number.
• If the received generated number is negative, write down how much the player lost, calculating the amount in the same way.
• Finally, note that the player has been evaluated.
• Implement the tryEvaluatePlayer() method.
• If it is not possible to evaluate new players, write this information to the standard output and return with a false logical value.
• If a new evaluation is possible, indicate it on the standard output.
• If the data structure containing the players to be evaluated is already full, then write this message to the standard output and return with false.
